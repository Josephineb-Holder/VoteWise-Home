According to the bush chicken news website, mandam Harris shared some of  her plans for the county in her petiton acceptance speech. These were her words "The people of Grand Bassa County need to be empowered. We must engage in and support programs that protect our citizens’ interests globally. We must work to ensure that our citizens have the opportunity to make a difference in their lives economically, and be trusted to drive their own destiny. We must work hard with citizens to develop their individual willpower to transform the future of their county. It is the political will and leadership we need to move the county forward to building sustainable institutions, growing the economy, and seeking fiscal monetary stability.”

      Harris, who lived in the U.S. for many years until she moved back a few years ago, said she grew up in the village and attended schools with no desks, books, or pencils – something that is still continuing today and needs to be changed.
      
      “We must find a way to work together with them and improve the condition of their lives,” she said. “After serving many humanitarian organizations, I am now ready to promote change through service in Grand Bassa County to make a break with the past for the better. Harris said if chosen for the Senate, she would focus on peacebuilding and social protection, growing the Grand Bassa economy, infrastructure development, and ensuring accountability.

      “We must grow our agriculture sector through farming, agro-processing, and marketing – encouraging small business development, creating opportunities for employment, focusing on workforce development, and encouraging direct foreign investment and partnerships,” she added."`,
